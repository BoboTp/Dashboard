### This code deploys a live intuitive Performance Dashboard

Data is read from a csv that are generated everyday from running multiple tests

This code uses two main python libraries PLOTLY and DASH

Plotly - Advanced version of matplotlib , has a lot more interactive features.

DASH - This package is used to develop a Dashboard such that it can be deployed later in any cloud platform.

The code has six different tabs one for each service

To mention them namely

1) Iperf in Layer 3
2) Wget in Layer 3
3) SCP in Layer 3
4) Iperf in Layer 2
5) Wget in Layer 2
6) SCP in Layer 2

I have generated scatter plot to analyze the change in performance everyday, multiple plots can be generated by this method.
